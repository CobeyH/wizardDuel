A cross platform implementation of the card game "Magic the Gathering". Supports up to 4 players using Google's Firebase to send communications between players.

There are different control schemes used on the two platforms.

Command + f will display the cards in your deck
Esc key will hide the tokens or the deck from display mode
The + and - keys can be used to increase and decreased your life total
Dragging a dice on top of a card will add a dice to that card. The value on the dice can be increased with a click and derceased with a right click

## IOS
A two finger pinch going outwards is used to display the deck while a closing pinch will hide it.
Holding down on a card will show a large copy of it in the top right corner, dragger your finger around will change the focused card.

# Importing a deck
Decks can be imported from a text file directly into the game. The first number represents the occurrences of the card and the second world on each line should be the name of the card.
Decks can also be uploaded from a computer to the database. This will allow iOS users to select from a pre-uploaded deck instead of creating a file on an iPad.

# New Turn
The "New Turn" button can be pressed to automatically untap all permanents owned by that player and draw a card from the top of the deck.
